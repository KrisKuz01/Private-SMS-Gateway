There will be a blog post linked to this project soon. In the meantime, create a mailbox and install Ubuntu with smstools. Afterwards create a cron job for the run.py script.
Associate phone numbers to the mailbox by creating an email alias (example 14503369292@test.com). This script will pull the phone number from the email and send the body of the email as a text message to 14503369292

1. Install Ubuntu and enable SSH
2. Install smstools
3. Connect the following SMS Modem: https://www.amazon.com/SIM800C-Wireless-Quad-Band-Communication-Transmission/dp/B087Z6F953
4. Following commands for installation

sudo apt update
sudo apt install smstools
sudo cp /etc/smsd.conf /etc/smsd.conf.bak (backup default config file)
sudo service smstools stop
sudo rm /etc/smsd.conf
sudo nano /etc/smsd.conf  (smsd.conf is present in the repository)

cd /var/spool/
cd  sms/
mkdir gsm1
ls -lthra
sudo chown smsd:smsd gsm1/ -R
sudo service smstools start
sudo chmod 777 /var/spool/sms/ -R
sudo chown www-data:smsd /var/spool/sms/ -R
ls -lthra

tail /var/log/smstools/smsd.log (will provide you the status of the modem)

PRTG ALERTING 

FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO BE ABLE TO CHECK IF THE MODEM IS FAILING TO SEND MESSAGES: https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/ssh_script_advanced_sensor



The PRTG-GMAIL-CHECK.py checks if the mailbox has any messages that have stopped being processed and creates an SNMP Alert within PRTG

Summary of the script for PRTG-GMAIL-CHECK.py:

This script is designed to check the number of emails in a Gmail account's INBOX using IMAP. If there are any emails present, it creates an error message stating the count and saves it to an error file. 
Additionally, it appends the error message to an archive file. If the error file already exists, it does nothing. Both the error file and the archive file are made writable. 
If there are no emails in the INBOX, it deletes the error file if it exists. Finally, the script closes the connection to the mailbox and logs out of the Gmail account.

The PRTG-MODEM-CHECK.sh checks the /var/spool/sms/gsm1 folder to see if there are any text messages pending over 5 minites. If yes, it'll create an SNMP Alert within PRTG
